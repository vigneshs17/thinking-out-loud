Last, I pondered about happiness and success and how one influences the other. It seemed pretty straightforward that happiness leads to success and that happiness isn’t an objective concept and that it has various connotations for various persons. But this was from the perspective of a single individual. But there’s more than one person on Earth and each person is not independent of the other.

This got me thinking about how the success and happiness of mankind are related to the success and happiness of a single individual. This is a much more complex situation as there are many more parts to consider. A single individual usually can not influence mankind’s fate. (Einstein, Newton, Oppenheimer, Gandhi,... kinda did, but they were exceptions) So, let’s limit ourselves to how mankind’s “progress” has affected the average human being.

The under-five child mortality rate declined by 61 per cent between 1990 and 2020. The global average life expectancy has more than doubled since 1900 and is now above 70 years. Since 1990, 2.6 billion people have gained access to an “improved” drinking water source. People have significantly better access to better health care and better education. These numbers paint an image of an unquestionable improvement in human life. We have easier and often affordable access to what we need. But does the satisfaction of these needs imply human happiness?

A framework to help define happiness might help, but in no way is it conclusive in deciding the outcome. A simple way to look at it is the satisfaction of needs and wants. A man who has fulfilled the requirements of his needs and wants is often happy. Abraham Maslow tried to consolidate it and came up with Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. 

He divides it into deficiency (basic) needs and growth needs. Basic needs are what one needs to survive and live properly. This includes needs such as air, water, food, sleep, shelter, sexual intercourse, and security (personal, emotional and financial). Family, friendship, and intimacy provide a sense of social belonging. Once these needs are met, man moves on to cognitive needs such as creativity, curiosity and meaning. Self-actualisation and transcendence needs are at the top of the pyramid and very rarely do people consider those needs let alone acknowledge them. 

It is futile to try to attain growth needs when basic needs haven’t been met. Looking back thousands of years ago, it might seem as though humans led a sub-optimal life because they didn’t have access to medical care, education, financial systems or governments. But these definitions change as time goes by. Their medical care was natural medicine using roots and leaves and their education was vocational and their financial system was barter and trust and their government was a system of tribes and communities with elders. It would be wrong to look at it through the lens of the current world. 

Now that it’s established that they didn’t have it worse, do we have it better? Objectively, yes. We live longer, healthier and safer lives. But what good is it if the basic needs are met and growth needs are neglected? 

Technology was designed to save our time and energy. We don’t have to physically go to stores to purchase something. We can hail a cab on an app. Send money to others. Order food. Watch a movie. The possibilities are endless.

Few could put it better than Jesse in Before Sunrise (1995), “It's all these people talking about how great technology is, and how it saves all this time. But, what good is saved time, if nobody uses it? If it just turns into more busy work.”

This is sort of true and is not a great indication of people trying to climb up the pyramid. Saved time is often used to get more work done. You rarely see people use it to help out others, learn something new or even take a break. 

Happiness is a function of your environment, current situation and the global climate (social, political, environmental). It changes as you attain various things in life. A lower-class family might be very happy when their child graduates from university (and lifts their social status) whereas for an upper-class child graduating from university might be a given. Maybe the right question isn’t: are you happy? More like are you trying to be happy? Because being happy is a current state and need not necessarily sustain. But trying to be happy (or anything else) requires sustained effort and factors in variable change.

Happiness is contagious. Your happiness (and/from success) spreads and this amplifies and results in the happiness (and/from success) of others. So in a way, you do influence the happiness of others.
