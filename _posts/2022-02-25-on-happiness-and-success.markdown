A fisherman sits by the river and waits for fish to catch his bait. Meanwhile, a successful businessman walking by notices the fisherman and approaches him. On a closer look, he observes that the fisherman had caught a good amount of fish. Surprised, he asks the fisherman about his catch that day and learns that the fisherman caught a lot of fish in a couple of hours.

The business acumen of the visitor kicked in and he was determined to help out this ‘naive’ fisherman. He asked the fisherman why he didnt fish for longer and catch more fish. The fisherman shrugged and stated that he was happy with the amount of effort he had put in that day. He couldn't wait to go home and spend quality time with his family and friends.

The business was surprised and relentless and definitely wanted to help out this gentleman. He pitched him an idea.

“First, you should spend more time catching more fish. With the increased profits, you can invest in a bigger boat and set further out to increase your catch. Next, you can hire a team of fishermen and captains and delegate your task. Finally, you can relax and reap profits while your men work for you.”

The fisherman asks, “What would I do then?”. The businessman replies, “After that, you can retire and spend quality time with your family and friends.

The fisherman then replies, “What do you think I am doing now?”. The businessman realised the irony and moved along.

I read this story for the nth time on Twitter (shoutout to [Sahil Bloom’s thread](https://twitter.com/sahilbloom/status/1363247431354257408) where he stresses on the importance of perspective). Now, you too might have heard this story before and chances are that there are a myriad of morals tied to this story. ‘You don’t need money to be happy.’ ‘Why work so hard and retire only to do the same thing at a later stage of your life?’ ‘Happiness is more important than success.’

But there may be more to it when you scratch the surface. Of course, you can perceive the story as you like but this is my two cents on another way of looking at it.

First off, we can all agree that age aside, the end result was the same in both cases: he gets to spend a good time with his family and friends. But the end result isn’t all that matters. How he got there plays an equally important part in the equation.

The fisherman put in a satisfactory amount of work and was happy. He did what was required of him; nothing more nothing less and devoted the rest of his time to his family. But according to the businessman’s plan, he would attain bliss by spending time with loved ones after going through a considerable amount of effort while setting up a business, creating more jobs, trading with consumers and contributing to the economy on a much larger scale. This is not something that can be ignored on a macro-scale.

Now, each side of the story may appeal to each one of you differently and that's totally fine. Because humans are not hardwired to prioritise the same things in life. Some value contentment, some value progress, some value helping others, some value success and some may value a balance of many ideals in varying amounts.

Although, what might help is listening to the story and contemplating how it aligns with your ideals.

Going back to the story, the fisherman was happy in the present. The businessman’s idea proposes happiness in the future. But the future happiness comes at the expense of years of effort into building his fishing business. That’s a gamble that not everyone might want to take. What if your business fails? What if your health takes a hit? What if there is a family emergency?

That’s part of the risk the fisherman has to take up if he wants to make it big. He might have had no problem building his fishing business if it gave him more happiness than spending time with his family. But he knew where his priorities lay. He was happy, yes. But who’s to say he wasn't successful.

People often confuse happiness and success and see them as two unrelated concepts. If you ponder over it for a moment, you might realise that they are actually intertwined. Now, the question is how are they related. Does happiness lead to success? Or does success lead to happiness?

Although research has answered this, (spoiler alert: happiness causes success), let’s keep that aside for now.

There is no quantitative way to measure one’s happiness but there are few indications: contentment, fulfilment, well-being and so on. Success, contrary to popular views, is not always measured by how much money you make or how much respect you command or what title you possess.

The ‘fisherman’ is a part of the man. Being a fisherman is one of the roles he takes on in his life. Apart from that, he plays the role of a father, a husband, a friend, a neighbour, a consumer among many others. Now the whole perspective changes, we no longer see him as a fisherman but as any other man in society. Doing his part as a fisherman as much as was required (by his priorities) enabled him to take on other roles happily. Simply put, he was happy with the amount and quality of time, money and energy he spent being a fisherman. This led to him being successful. Not him owning a prosperous fishing business or thousands of people working for him.

This happiness and success that he gained from fishing spilled over to other parts of his life. He spent a good amount of time doing everything that he loved and cherished. This is a hard-hitting point. The happiness that you get in one part of your life positively impacts everything else that you do. That may be why happy people tend to be healthier, have a good relationship with their work, and form meaningful relationships. Each thought, each action they perform is in line with keeping them happy.

Deriving that happiness from whatever source is, of course, based on the individual. For some it’s family, for some it’s work, for some it’s service, for some it's science.

How happiness and success are related is pretty clear in the case of individuals. What happens if more than one individual is involved? Is a society’s success a direct consequence of individual happiness? Does mankind’s progress imply human happiness?
