A couple of weeks ago, I read about an incident where an Air India Express (IX613) flight, a B737, made an emergency landing at Trichy airport (IATA: TRZ) due to a hydraulic failure in the landing gear assembly. The landing gear failed to retract shortly after takeoff and the pilots decided to perform an emergency landing. But why did the flight circle over Trichy for nearly two hours before the emergency landing?

This is to get rid of excess fuel by dumping it or burning it off. Whether an aircraft dumps fuel or burns it by circling overhead depends on several factors.

Every commercial aircraft has a maximum take-off weight (MTOW), which is the maximum weight the aircraft can be at during take-off; this includes the aircraft’s weight, fuel, passengers, and cargo. Similarly, another important term is the maximum landing weight (MLW), which is the maximum weight the aircraft can be at when it lands. This is a function of the design limitations of the aircraft, especially the landing gears. If the aircraft’s weight during landing exceeds the MTW, the landing gear may experience structural damage. The maximum landing weight is almost always lower than the maximum take-off weight.

Therefore, in case of emergency landings, it is necessary that the aircraft’s weight while landing does not exceed its maximum landing weight. The only weight that the aircraft can reduce is the fuel weight. This is when aircrafts either dump their fuel or engage in a holding pattern (going in circles).

In case of fuel dumping, fuel is diverted to nozzles along the wingtips by valves and pumps. These systems can dump up to thousands of litres of fuel per second. To ensure the safety of those living on the ground, fuel dumping is permissible only when the aircraft is at least 6000 feet above ground level. This ensures that the fuel evaporates before hitting the ground. Fuel dumping is not possible on all aircrafts. It is mainly limited to aircrafts that have a significant difference in their MTOW and MLW, this is primarily observed in wide-body aircrafts like the 777, 747 and A350. For example, the 777–300ER has an MTOW of 351,533 kg and an MLW of 251,290 kg. (You can read more about that here.) On the other hand, the 737 (the narrow body involved in the emergency landing) has an MTOW of 79,016 kg and an MLW of 66,349 kg. Due to the small difference between the two weights, narrow-body aircrafts don’t need a fuel dump system; instead, they perform holding patterns to burn the excess to meet the maximum landing weight. The exact requirements for needing a fuel dump system is defined in Federal Aviation Regulations 25.1001 the discussion of which is outside the scope of this piece.
