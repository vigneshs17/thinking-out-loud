Back in the winter of 2024 when the BGT was going on, I and a majority of the people were irked by the “weakness” of Virat Kohli when it came to attempting the length ball pitched outside off. That was a major point of talk during the season. Eight of his nine dismissals were when the ball was pitched outside off. As a Virat Kohli fan, it was gut-wrenching to watch your idol fall prey to the same delivery over and over again. So, I decided to do a little digging and find out once and for all if his weakness was really a big deal as everyone made it out to be.

Before we begin, a small note to all the Virat Kohli fans who are reading this. Please don’t bash me. I am one of you. I started working on this hoping his weakness would be a minor blip in his stellar career. It was incredibly difficult to critique his weaknesses, particularly in Test cricket. Perhaps our criticism reflects the exceptionally high standards he has set for himself — and that we, as fans, have come to expect from him.

To start off, I pulled up all the scorecards of every international match that ever happened during Virat’s tenure up until the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024–2025 and then filtered those where he made an appearance. I then obtained information regarding his dismissals — the bowler, method of dismissal, year, fielder, fielding position (if caught), opponent, venue and format. Among the dismissals where he was caught out, to determine if he was caught outside off at the fifth stump line, I pored through the commentary to determine if he had edged the ball to the slips or the wicketkeeper. The question of whether it was a true weakness against deliveries outside off stump remained subjective.

Virat Kohli was dismissed for a total of 531 in international cricket. Out of 531 dismissals, being caught (353 times) was the most common, followed by being lbw, which occurred 63 times. I deduced that Kohli was caught outside off along the fifth stump line 102 times accounting for 29% of his caught out dismissals.

In the following series of graphs, we compare dismissals caught outside off to the total number of times he was caught. Each bar represents the percentage of that dismissal type out of the total dismissals.

Firstly, let’s analyse how he fared against each opponent. Focussing our attention on the Test-playing nations since they are the most common teams that India faces internationally, we see that he has been caught outside off a decent amount of times against Australia, England, South Africa and Bangladesh. The statistic for the USA can be safely disregarded, as he was caught only once against them — and that too outside off.

Next comes up one of my favourite parts which is comparing how he managed against contemporary bowlers. Considering only bowlers who dismissed Kohli at least 5 times, he was beaten the most by James Anderson, Mitchell Starc, Ben Stokes, Pat Cummins, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel and Scott Boland, highlighting the success of fast bowlers exploiting hard and bouncy pitches to get him out.

Let’s now examine how he has performed across different venues. First off, it seems pretty evident that he has struggled more in SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia) conditions. The pitches in SENA countries are known to favour pace, and the performance of Asian batsmen on these pitches serves as a litmus test of their batting prowess.

Finally, let’s consider two of the most insightful graphs that will help us effectively conclude if Virat had a weakness facing outside off deliveries.

Right off the bat, we can see that he had developed that weakness only during the tail end of his career particularly in Test cricket. The figures seem to be minimal in ODIs and T20Is from 2008 till 2023, with spikes in 2018 and 2021. This seems to explain a lot. A world-class batsman had suddenly been dismissed by more than a few good-length deliveries outside the off stump.

I was trying to understand why the figures were so bad in Test cricket. My search led me down a Reddit thread. The batsman’s mindset is fundamentally different in red ball cricket and white ball cricket. In white ball cricket, you try to attempt everything, but that is not the case with red ball cricket. You leave some balls and you attempt some. Batters have a set way of playing certain lines and lengths. For short-length deliveries, the optimal strategy is to leave the ball. Against full-length deliveries, committing to the shot is essential to minimise the risk of being bowled or trapped lbw. When the ball is on the stump line, it is advisable to commit but leave the delivery if it is pitching outside off stump. But what do you do if there is a full length ball away from the stumps? Do you go at it because it is a length ball or do you leave it because it is away from the stumps? The length might be tempting to attempt but if the line is read incorrectly, out you go. This is further eexacerbated by Virat’s iconic cover drive. All these decisions must be made in a split second, making them inherently challenging. As a player ages, the ability to consistently execute such rapid judgments tends to decline.

We can now safely assert that his weakness against deliveries outside off stump is a recent but significant issue. It plagued him majorly during his final BGT; no wonder he called it “the most intense kind of disappointment”. He started off the series with an unbeaten 100 in Perth, but in eight of his subsequent innings, he was dismissed after nicking the ball outside off. He finished the series with 190 runs with an average of 23.75.

As a die-hard Kohli fan, it pains me deeply to accept that I may never witness my idol don the Test whites again. Yet, beyond the stats and struggles, I see the immense pressure and challenges he faced — and I understand why he decided to retire from Test cricket. Virat’s cricketing journey has been nothing short of extraordinary, and while this recent weakness marked a difficult chapter, it cannot undermine the legacy of a player who has inspired millions like me. I will forever cherish the moments he gave us on the field.

You did well, King. You did well.
