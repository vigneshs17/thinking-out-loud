In the summer of 2022, I went on my first solo trip to Azerbaijan. I’d been wanting to check out the ex-Soviet state for quite a while, and the timing couldn’t have been more perfect with the Azerbaijan Grand Prix happening at the same time.

One of the first places I checked out was the Fire Temple of Baku (or Baku Ateshgah). Built between the 17th and 18th centuries, it was used as a place of worship by the Hindus, Sikhs and Zoroastrians. Fire is considered sacred in Hinduism and Zoroastrianism. The eternal fire at the temple was fueled by vents supplying natural gas from the subterranean gas fields. The ‘natural’ fire was exhausted in 1969 owing to the discovery and exploitation of the natural gas reserves of Azerbaijan during Soviet rule. Today, the fire is kept alive by artificial gas pipes. The temple served as a caravanserai (a place of rest for merchants and pilgrims), and monks permanently residing at the temple often tortured themselves with heavy chains around their necks or positioned their hands in a certain position for years until they atrophied.

There are several ‘fires’ in the temple complex and inscriptions in Sanskrit, Punjabi and Persian.

This was followed by two days of witnessing the Grand Prix in the blistering heat and getting sunburnt. Standing in line for 2 hours was more than worth it for meeting 4-time world champion Sebastian Vettel. The thrill of a street circuit is unparalleled in terms of proximity to the track and the roar of the powerful engines. Fans with F1 circuit maps tattoed on their biceps aptly describes the craze and fervour at the Baku race.

Next up on the itinerary were the mud volcanoes and the historical site of Gobustan, guided by a passionate local guide. Mud volcanoes, unlike typical volcanoes, spew out an emulsion of mud and water, which are cold to the touch. This, again, is caused by the natural gas escaping through vents in the Earth’s crust. Natural gas seeping through the ground seems to be a common phenomenon in and around Baku, as the city lies 28 m below sea level. The ‘lava’ is claimed to have therapeutic effects on the skin.

The Gobustan site, close to the mud volcanoes, is home to famous rock petroglyphs, the oldest of which dates to the 38th millennium BC. The rock carvings are primitive in nature and depict the livelihood, lifestyle and craft of the local people.

The following day, Elmar, a friendly and enthusiastic Azeri, took a group of us on a tour to Khinalig, village located at an altitude of 2350m. The journey there took us through various landscapes ranging from deserts, grasslands, forests and mountains. We were served a delicious lunch by a very hospitable local family.

After getting scammed by a non-existent agency for $500, I took a half-day break and decided to go on a pop culture walking tour later on in the day. We were told stories of local buildings and streets and their cultural and historical significance. The oil barons of Baku city had built themselves lavish homes with extravagant ceiling art and paintings. During Soviet rule, the government seized these properties and distributed them among the proletariat. It felt comical to learn that homes once owned by the richest men of Baku were now inhabited by the common folk.

Feeling a little wild, I fancied visiting a town alone without any guided tour. That’s exactly what I did when I took a bus to Sheki, a cosy, little town along the historic Silk Road. It was a 6-hour long bus journey. Google translate saved my life that day as I, not knowing the local language, struggled to converse with the locals. They were very hospitable and I enjoyed a nice cup of Azeri çay (chai) with some fellow passengers. One could notice the stark difference in the levels of development between Baku and the other cities. The countryside was much more serene and slow-paced.

The Palace of Shaki Khans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a notable attraction and must not be missed. It features beautiful and intricate stained-glass windows called shebeke; the glasses were imported from Murano. Sheki, being one of the biggest cities of the Alban states historically, is home to the Church of Kish, built in the 5th century.

Returning to Baku for the last day of my trip, I checked out the fantastic Azerbaijan Carpet Museum and explored the city. I met Stephen, a Brit who’s been travelling east since February 2022. You should check out [his blog](https://stephenlefanu.wordpress.com), where he covers his adventures.

Visiting Baku was an amazing experience, and it exposed me to cultures, ideas and experiences I would never have experienced otherwise. From what I saw, it was a very liberal and tolerant place. As a brown tourist, I was the subject of many stares and pleasant interactions, with the locals wanting to know why I had chosen to visit Azerbaijan.

Azeri nationalism was deeply instilled in the minds of the locals. In Sheki, during a conversation with a bunch of kids playing, I was surprised to learn that propaganda had seeped upto their level. Almost everyone I conversed with had been affected in some way or the other because of the war in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

Another striking aspect of Baku is the magnificent architecture, earning it the name ‘Paris of the East’. Quite a lot of buildings were designed by Polish architects. The hostel I stayed at was in a building built in the 1870s. The architecture widely varies within the city, from the Old City to the modern style along the Baku Boulevard to the Soviet-era buildings mostly used as government offices. One can see many parks and green gardens, and fountains in Baku.

The nightlife in Baku is not to be missed. A night-long pub crawl brought out stories and experiences at the end of which a couple of us were scouring the streets looking for someone to gain entry into a bar.

My first solo trip taught me so much more than I could have anticipated, and I enjoyed every second of it.

One thing I missed out on was taking a dip in the Caspian Sea. But maybe I will do that the next time I go to Baku.
